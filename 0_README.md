A brief description of provided presets.

1. **0_Test.txt**: Useful for simply testing functionality. All units have the same health (5) and damage (2), except for the mine, which can only be used once and has 5 damage (so it should kill an enemy unit immediately). There are only two waves. The first wave requires 2 enemies to be killed. The second requires 3 (demonstrates the usage of increments over multiple waves). The minigame will be conducted after completion of the first wave.
